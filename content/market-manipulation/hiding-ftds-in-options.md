This is a more technical theory that claims Market Makers are hiding/ resetting FTDs through deep ITM options. Personally, I'm not an options expert, so I haven't been following this theory this closely. But you know who is an expert on this theory? John W Welborn at Dartmouth College. You know who else is an expert? The bloody SEC. Here are their papers.
