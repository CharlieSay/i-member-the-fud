After all the market manipulation we have seen, the problem of Payment for Order Flow seems oddly insignificant. Personally, I believe that the only reason this was brought up in the hearing was to purposely ignore the many elephants in the room. But if anyone is interested, here's the testimony of Dennis Kelleher from the second GameStop hearing.
